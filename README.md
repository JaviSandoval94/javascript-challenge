# Introduction
UFO enthusiasts, today is your lucky day! Large data sets are often required to be available to the public, especially in collective tasks such as UFO sightings. Web applications are perfect to accomplish this! This project uses basic Javascript to create a simple web application which can retrieve UFO sightings data from the USA and Canada based on filtered selections. The webpage was created using Javascript, HTML and Bootstrap, using the Bootswatch CDN templates(https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/bootswatch/). The project is divided into two search levels, each one with its own directory within the repository:
* Level 1: Automatic sightings table from date search. You can see the deployed visualization here.
* Level 2: Multiple search categories. You can see the deployed visualization here.

# Data sets
The complete data set can be found in the `data.js` file contained in the `static > js` folder of both directories. This data set was provided by the Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey Data Analytics Bootcamp for the February - August 2020 term.

# Code description
This repository contains the folders `UFO-level-1` and `UFO-level-2`. Each of these directories works on the corresponding task level. To run any of these sripts, make sure to have the complete `static` folder available in your working directory, since this contains the required `css`, `images` and `js` to run the code. The final visualizations are shown in the `index.html` template.
